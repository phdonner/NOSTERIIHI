## The village network cooperative

Right now my primary occupation is development of fiber optic network maintenance systems and tools for village networks. I'm doing this more or less full-time voluntary work for our rural network cooperative: Kuhmon kylÃ¤verkko-osuuskunta (formerly Luoteis-Kuhmon kylÃ¤verkko-osuuskunta). The cooperatife mainly operates in the north-western part of Kuhmo municipality, at the Russian border right on the 64th latitude, which divides Finland into two equally sized parts. 

Currently, the cooperative is preparing a smart rural project. Please study the cooperative's [Smart Rural 27 pages](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/), in case you would like to have a look at all the preparatory work that we have been doing. The pages are a mix of Finnish and English content, but most often with summaries in both directions. Internationalism and [multilingual methods](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/markdown.md#multilingual-markdown) are actually vital themes of this site. That is an energy-consuming, but important aspect of our task.

## Towards a self-reliant information society

The preparatory phase of our project is called NOSTERIIHI, literally the 'uplift barn' while also aluding to brainstorming (fin. 'aivoriihi'). The project is based on the assumption that we are experiencing the first phases of an emerging new mode of production. In the _information society_, many or perhaps most aspects of production are somehow dependent on information technology. Rural inhabitants in our environment don't want to be spectators of that process, but active agents. Deep understanding and early adoption of the new tools of production can be an asset in rural, scarcely populated environments.

Market driven production creates unnecessary expenses, These are often motivated by IT expenses and the desire of producing a surplus for the investors. Think of the quickly growing bank fees. Often concrete production costs are obscured by abstract concepts like digitization or artificial intelligence. At the same time some of the most potential advantages of information society construction - first of all automation - remain unused. Here the focus is reversed. The project stresses the importance of simple, but effective IT tools and bottom-up and peer oriented collaboration as inroads on the way towards the zero marginal cost society.
