# Discussion with SVN coordinators (2024-11-13)

Informal chat on where we are, what the main themes are that we focus on and how the Smart Village Network could support the village network cooperative and Iivantiira village. 
  
## Where we are right now

In Finland, rural development is coordinated by the Finnish food authority. Marianne SelkÃ¤inaho introduced an excellent initiative by offering a small support budget for actors who would like to crystallize their ideas and plans in a preparatory project. The cooperative got funding for the NOSTERIIHI (the brainstorming barn) project.

Kuhmo village network cooperative took advantage of this possibility. It resulted in very fruitful work where the cooperative could reflect upon the various (often internally related) ideas that we had considered to strengthen the cooperative and to improve our productivity. The results were presented in partly bilingual articles at [the cooperative's Smart Rural 27 column](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/) and in a number of [repositories at the GitHub developer](https://github.com/phdonner/NOSTERIIHI/) site.

NOSTERIIHI focused on ENERGY and the Information Society, which as a presentor from Stanz at the Graz conference cleverly pointed out, are two infrastructure assets which are closely related.

## What are the main themes that we focus on

These topics have been presented on the cooperative's site. The relevant articles have illustrations and English summaries, so it might be worthwhile to have look at them.

* Energy effective village networks

The cooperative has prepared systems for energy efficient downloading, storage and reporting of electricity at the cooperative's machine rooms. The concepts will be validated and a number of variations will be piloted while deploying the systems in an investment project.

* [Measuring energy consumption](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/sahkoenergian-mittaus/)

* Support for village information society infrastructures

NOSTERIIHI proposed an innovatory domain name structure which could facilitate use and maintenance of web pages, while eliminating unnecessary yearly subscription fees for the domain names. This sub project introduces the use of Raspberry Pi systems as village web servers and other rural tasks. The project underlines the need for resiliency in crisis situations.

* Precise location GIS service for village developers and cultivators

Geographical Information systems are a core infrastructure for village network planners and maintainers, as well as cultivators. The cooperative has teamed with a Finnish RTK GIS developer who has developed low cost decimeter precision.

* A LoRaWan infrastructure for home and enterprise automation

Iivantiira developed a LoRaWan resource for the village. The system took advantage of telecom terrestrials. Meanwhile, it became evident that the approach suffered by dead spots, similar to the ones encountered in mobile phone systems. It was discovered that the village network offers a much more affordable alternative, with gateway equipment distributed all over the network. The pilot subproject will include eyeopening experiments in fishing, agriculture and home automation.

## How SVN could support the cooperative (and other actors with similar orientation)

* So far it seems it has been difficult to bring about exchange between European SVN actors

European cooperation could be a huge bonus, but despite the potential, for us there has been very little action
It has been more rewarding to participate in other peer networks
  
* What about a smart rural good practices handbook?

The European rural development newsletter has been an asset.
Finland has a [national register](https://maaseutuverkosto.fi/hankkeet/), but while the national coordinators have been active in the site, rural participation has been pretty scarce. Are we too shy?
  
* Support for internationalism

This is partly a Kainuu specific problem. The problems are: Lack of language competence, focus on English
In the Leader Action Group I've proposed use of international experts, without any following.
  
* Engagement in the struggle for peace and disarmament

Kuhmo is a border municipality. We don't want to become the next Ukraine. 
The program of the government is called [A strong and committed Finland](https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/governments/government-programme#/). What about getting committed to peace and disarmament?
  
Would it be of any help to publish these notes in the Finnish rural network?
