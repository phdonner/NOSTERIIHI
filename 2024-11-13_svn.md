# Discussion with SVN coordinators (2024-11-13)

Informal chat on where we are, what the main themes we focus on and how the Smart Village Network could support us. 
  
## Where we are right now

## What are the main themes that we focus on

## How SVN could support the cooperative (and other actors with similar orientation)




* So far it seems it has been difficult to bring about exchange between European SVN actors

European cooperation could be a huge bonus, but despite the potential, for us there has been very little action
It has been more rewarding to participate in other peer networks
  
* What about a smart rural good practices handbook?

The European rural development newsletter has been an asset.
Finland has a [national register](https://maaseutuverkosto.fi/hankkeet/), but while the national coordinators have been active in the site, rural participation has been pretty scarce. Are we too shy?
  
* Support for internationalism

This is partly a Kainuu specific problem. The problems are: Lack of language competence, focus on English
In the Leader Action Group I've proposed use of international experts, without any following.
  
* Engagement in the struggle for peace and disarmament

Kuhmo is a border municipality. We don't want to become the next Ukraine. 
The program of the government is called [A strong and committed Finland](https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/governments/government-programme#/). What about getting committed to peace and disarmament?
  
Would it be of any help to publish these notes in the Finnish rural network?
